Output of the neural network is the fruit the agent should go to. Problem: How to label the fruit so that the neural network can learn over the course of several geames. Possibility. Output layer size = number of max fruit. Input is also the mapping giving each fruit in the current state a number. Then iterative: Go through each fruit and rate it with a nukber between 0 and 1. Later take the fruit with teh highest score. If two fruits have the same score choose randomely between them. Has the benefit that you can give summary statistics as input as well, which the neural network does not have to learn. So input is the position of the player, the game sioze, the position of the fruits, the distance between each fruit to another fruit and so on. This way teh neural network learns the correlation between these values and rates each fruit. Question: Does this acoount for cooperation well enough? Should. "
